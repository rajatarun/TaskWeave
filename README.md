Here’s a README.md for your project TaskWeave, structured for clarity and collaboration:

⸻

🧠 TaskWeave

TaskWeave is a dynamic, JSON-driven agent framework built on LangChain and LangGraph. It allows you to spin up intelligent, configurable LLM-powered pipelines where each “tool” or “agent” performs a specific task, such as making API calls, analyzing data, or invoking LLM prompts.

Designed for rapid prototyping and robust orchestration in data and software workflows.

⸻

⚙️ Features
	•	🔄 JSON-defined task flows
	•	🧩 Modular tasks (llm_prompt, api_call, analysis, etc.)
	•	☁️ Config and tool definitions fetched from S3
	•	🔗 Output chaining between tools
	•	🧠 OpenAI LLMs via openai Python SDK
	•	👥 Specialized agents for dev, QA, and analytics roles


🧠 How It Works
	1.	Startup: Loads JSON from S3 or local config/ folder.
	2.	Initialization: Each task is mapped to a tool defined in tools.json.
	3.	Execution:
	•	Tasks are dynamically resolved based on input dependencies.
	•	LLM calls are made via OpenAI Python SDK (not raw HTTP).
	•	Output of each task is stored and passed to dependent tasks.

🚀 Running Locally (Intel Mac)

1. Create virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

2. Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set environment variables:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
export CONFIG_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name  # Optional if using S3

4. Run main pipeline:

python main.py

🧠 Contributing

We’re looking for:
	•	⚡ Tool authors (build more reusable tools!)
	•	🧪 Reviewers to test new agents
	•	🧠 Feedback from real-world data/LLM pipeline use

Feel free to open issues or submit PRs!
